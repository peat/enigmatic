# Enigmatic

_An [Enigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine)-like rotor machine!_

This doesn't simulate any of the famous Enigma machines, but it does allow you to build entertaining programs for learning about mechanical [polyalphabetic ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyalphabetic_cipher) and [rotor machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotor_machine).

## Goals

1. **To have fun tinkering with [Rust](https://rust-lang.org).** This is a hobby, and I've fallen in love with the language for it's speed, expressiveness, and safety.
2. **Easy configurability and expansion.** Enigmatic represents all of the essential components of an Enigma machine (plug board, rotors, reflector), but none of the specific eccentricities. It also can be extended _far_ beyond what's possible with a mechanical system.
3. **Building absurd toy encryption systems.** None of this will protect you from anyone with an ounce of code breaking experience.
